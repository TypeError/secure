## üõ°Ô∏è Security Headers

Secure Headers supports many critical HTTP security headers. Below is a list of headers you can configure, along with detailed documentation for each:

- [Cache-Control](./headers/cache_control.md)  
  Configure caching behavior to protect sensitive content.

- [Content-Security-Policy](./headers/content_security_policy.md)  
  Prevent XSS and data injection attacks by controlling allowed content sources.

- [Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy](./headers/cross_origin_embedder_policy.md)  
  Enhance cross-origin security by specifying cross-origin resource policies.

- [Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy](./headers/cross_origin_opener_policy.md)  
  Prevent attackers from accessing your global objects via cross-origin documents.

- [Custom Headers](./headers/custom_header.md)  
  Define and manage custom HTTP headers for advanced configurations.

- [Permissions-Policy](./headers/permissions_policy.md)  
  Control access to browser features such as geolocation, camera, and microphone.

- [Referrer-Policy](./headers/referrer_policy.md)  
  Manage how much referrer information is shared during navigation.

- [Server](./headers/server.md)  
  Hide or customize the `Server` header to prevent exposing your server details.

- [Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)](./headers/strict_transport_security.md)  
  Ensure that communication is only over HTTPS by enforcing strict transport security.

- [X-Content-Type-Options](./headers/x_content_type_options.md)  
  Prevent MIME-sniffing attacks by ensuring the browser follows the declared `Content-Type`.

- [X-Frame-Options](./headers/x_frame_options.md)  
  Protect against clickjacking by controlling whether your content can be framed.
